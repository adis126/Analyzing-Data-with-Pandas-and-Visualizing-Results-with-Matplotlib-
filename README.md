📊 Data Analysis & Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
🎯 Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to:

Load and explore a dataset using pandas.

Perform basic statistical analysis and groupings.

Create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Practice handling errors and cleaning data.

📂 Files Included

assignment.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.

assignment.py → Python script version (optional).

README.md → Documentation of the project.

📝 Tasks Completed
✅ Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

Dataset: Iris dataset (from sklearn.datasets)

Steps performed:

Loaded dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Displayed first 5 rows using .head().

Checked structure (.info()), data types, and missing values.

Cleaned missing values (if any).

✅ Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

Computed basic statistics (.describe()).

Grouped data by species and calculated the average petal length.

Observed that Setosa has significantly smaller petals than other species.

✅ Task 3: Data Visualization

Created 4 types of visualizations:

📈 Line Chart → Trend of Sepal Length across samples.

📊 Bar Chart → Average Petal Length by species.

📉 Histogram → Distribution of Sepal Width.

🌐 Scatter Plot → Relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length (colored by species).

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

pandas → Data loading & analysis

matplotlib → Plotting charts

seaborn → Advanced visualization styling

scikit-learn → Loading Iris dataset

📌 Findings

Setosa species has the smallest petal length and width.

Virginica generally has the largest features.

Positive correlation observed between sepal length and petal length


🙏 Final Ubuntu Blessing:
“May your code be clean, your charts be clear, and your heart remember — behind every row, there is a person.
Analyze with wisdom. Serve with compassion.
I am because we are.”
